# lamdera-auth0

This repository contains a minimal implementation of a Auth0 login flow in [Lamdera](https://lamdera.com/).

The example is implemented using [truqu/elm-oauth2](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/truqu/elm-oauth2/8.0.1/) 
with the [Authorization Code grant type](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/truqu/elm-oauth2/latest/OAuth-AuthorizationCode) 
and follows the flow suggested [here](https://discord.com/channels/654415002224295940/654415002869956622/934824899770450040).

This example is by no means perfect, but can be used as a starting point for implementing Auth0 in a Lamdera app
